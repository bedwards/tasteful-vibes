## SHORT BIO (50-75 words)

**Option A (Results-focused)**
```
I'm a vibe coding expert who has shipped 100+ projects using Claude Code and AI-first development. From healthcare platforms to Rust audio plugins to Roblox games—I deliver production-ready software in days, not months. Full-time teacher by day, prolific builder by night. If you need it built fast and built right, let's talk.
```

**Option B (Credibility-focused)**
```
Software developer with 145+ public repositories across 6 verticals: education, healthcare, music, gaming, data science, and e-commerce. I specialize in rapid prototyping with Claude Code, turning ideas into deployed products faster than traditional teams. Previously built enterprise software; now I help startups and businesses ship at startup speed.
```

**Option C (Problem-focused)**
```
Tired of 6-month development timelines? I use AI-first development to deliver in weeks. I've built Google Classroom automation tools, a healthcare platform in 28 days, Rust VST plugins, and 15+ Roblox games. My approach: describe what you want, I make it happen. No bureaucracy. No bloat. Just shipped software.
```

---

## MEDIUM BIO (100-150 words)

**Option A (Story-driven)**
```
I'm Brian Edwards—full-time teacher, part-time machine.

While teaching at Future Educator Academy in Waco, Texas, I've somehow managed to ship over 100 projects using Claude Code and AI-first development. Healthcare platforms. Audio plugins in Rust. Roblox games. Google Classroom automation. Kaggle competitions.

How? Vibe coding. I describe what I want to build, and AI helps me build it at 4x speed. The Folk Care healthcare platform? 28 days, 312 commits. A complete Shopify theme? One weekend.

I'm not just fast—I'm thorough. TypeScript, Python, Rust, React, Node.js, Cloudflare. I pick the right tool for the job and ship production-ready code.

If you've got a project that's been stuck in "planning phase" for months, I can probably have it deployed by next week. Let's build something.
```

**Option B (Services-driven)**
```
I deliver software projects in a fraction of the traditional timeline using AI-first development with Claude Code.

WHAT I BUILD:
• Web applications (React, Astro, Node.js)
• Automation tools and scripts
• API integrations and backends
• Audio plugins (Rust, VST3/CLAP)
• Game development (Roblox/Luau)
• Data pipelines and ML projects

MY APPROACH:
I use "vibe coding"—AI-assisted development where I architect solutions and leverage Claude Code to handle implementation. This isn't copy-paste AI slop. It's directed, intentional engineering at 4x velocity.

TRACK RECORD:
• 145+ public repositories
• 6 industry verticals
• Projects ranging from 28-day healthcare platforms to weekend Shopify themes

I work with startups, small businesses, and teams who need to move fast without sacrificing quality. Fixed-price projects or hourly consulting available.
```

**Option C (Differentiation-driven)**
```
Most developers will quote you 3-6 months. I'll quote you 3-6 weeks.

I've spent the last two years mastering AI-first development with Claude Code, shipping 100+ projects while teaching full-time. The secret isn't working harder—it's working differently.

Traditional development: Write code line by line. Debug for hours. Rewrite when requirements change.

My approach: Describe the architecture. Let AI generate the implementation. Review, refine, ship. Iterate at conversation speed.

This isn't about replacing developers with AI. It's about one developer producing the output of a small team. I've done it for healthcare (Folk Care platform), education (Google Classroom tools), music (Rust audio plugins), and gaming (15+ Roblox titles).

Your competitors are already adopting this. Don't get left behind.

## LONG BIO / ABOUT (200-300 words)

**Option A (Comprehensive)**
```
I'm Brian Edwards, a vibe coding expert based in Waco, Texas. By day, I teach at Future Educator Academy. By night (and weekends, and lunch breaks), I build software at a pace that surprises even me.

THE NUMBERS:
• 100+ projects shipped with Claude Code
• 145 public repositories
• 6 industry verticals: education, healthcare, music, gaming, data science, e-commerce
• Typical delivery: 4x faster than traditional development

WHAT I'VE BUILT:
Folk Care is a production healthcare platform I built in 28 days—features that enterprise vendors charge $750-2,250/user/month for. Ghost Note is a Rust VST3/CLAP plugin that converts poetry to melody. I've shipped 15+ Roblox games, Google Classroom automation tools, Kaggle competition entries, and Shopify themes.

MY STACK:
Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Luau, PHP, Java
Frameworks: React, Astro, Node.js, Cloudflare Workers
Tools: Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Bitwig Studio
Specialties: Rapid prototyping, API integrations, automation, audio DSP

WHY WORK WITH ME:
I'm not a prompt jockey who pastes AI output and hopes it works. I'm an experienced engineer who uses AI as a force multiplier. I architect systems, direct AI implementation, review every line, and ship production-ready code.

I work with startups who need an MVP yesterday, businesses who need internal tools without enterprise timelines, and teams who want training on AI-first development.

VALUES:
I prioritize open source, education, healthcare access, and creative tools. I don't work with defense contractors or federal government projects.

Let's build something remarkable.
```

**Option B (Narrative)**
```
Two years ago, I was a decent developer who built things at a decent pace. Then I discovered Claude Code and vibe coding, and everything changed.

I started shipping projects in days instead of months. A healthcare platform in 28 days. A portfolio site in one session. Audio plugins, Roblox games, automation tools—each one faster than the last.

The more I built, the more I understood: this isn't about AI replacing developers. It's about developers who embrace AI outpacing those who don't. I've now shipped 100+ projects while maintaining a full-time teaching job. That's not hustle culture—that's leverage.

HERE'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED:
The bottleneck was never typing speed. It was iteration speed. With AI-first development, I can try three approaches in the time it used to take to finish one. Bad ideas fail fast. Good ideas ship fast.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:
If you hire me, you're not just getting a developer. You're getting someone who has spent thousands of hours refining AI-assisted workflows. I know which prompts work. I know when to let AI lead and when to take over manually. I know how to review AI-generated code for security, performance, and maintainability.

MY VERTICALS:
Education (Google Classroom, lesson planning), Healthcare (Folk Care platform, EVV systems), Music (Rust VST plugins, Bitwig extensions), Gaming (Roblox development), Data Science (Kaggle, graph neural networks), E-commerce (Shopify themes).

I take on fixed-price projects, hourly consulting, and team training engagements. I deliver fast, communicate clearly, and don't disappear mid-project.

Ready to see what AI-first development can do for your timeline?
```

**Option C (Bold/Provocative)**
```
Let me be direct: if you're still developing software the traditional way, you're already behind.

I've shipped 100+ projects in two years using Claude Code and AI-first development. Not side projects—production software. A healthcare platform handling real patient data. Audio plugins used by real musicians. Games played by real players.

While other developers debate whether AI will take their jobs, I've been using it to do the work of a small team. The Folk Care healthcare platform? Traditional vendors would quote 6-12 months and $500k+. I built it in 28 days.

THIS ISN'T MAGIC. IT'S METHOD.

Vibe coding is a skill. You need to know how to architect systems AI can implement. How to review generated code for security holes. How to prompt effectively without endless back-and-forth. I've refined this over thousands of hours.

WHAT I OFFER:

Project Delivery: You describe what you need. I deliver it in 1/4 the traditional timeline. Web apps, APIs, automation, plugins—I've built it all.

Workflow Consulting: I audit your development process and show you where AI can cut your timeline.

Team Training: I teach your engineers vibe coding through hands-on workshops on your actual codebase.

THE FINE PRINT:

I don't work with defense contractors or federal government. I prioritize open source, healthcare, education, and creative tools. I communicate clearly, deliver on time, and don't nickel-and-dime on scope.

Your competitors are adopting AI-first development right now. The gap between fast-movers and slow-movers is widening every month.

Which side do you want to be on?
