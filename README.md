## What Is This?

An interactive portfolio showcasing 100+ projects built with vibe coding and Claude Code. Every page features an AI chat assistant (powered by Groq) that can answer questions about Brian's work, skills, and approach.

## The Pitch

**If you're not vibe coding, you're already behind.**

Traditional software development is dead. The engineers who embrace AI-assisted development today will dominate the market tomorrow. Those who don't will find themselves obsolete faster than they can say "agile methodology."

I build in days what used to take months. I deliver in weeks what used to take quarters. And I can teach your team to do the same.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro with React islands
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages
- **AI**: Cloudflare Workers AI + Groq API
- **Payments**: Stripe (via Cloudflare Worker proxy)
- **Style**: Tailwind CSS (terminal/coder aesthetic)
